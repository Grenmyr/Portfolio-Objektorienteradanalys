        In this model we decided to add the attribute - active for our Boat object. It describes if the boat is currently
        owned by the member. This will be communicated to our employer.

    <p>
        Object History is yearly data containing Boats and Parkinglot objects).
        It is there for our system to show the Parkinglot history. System will need that when handle bookings
        based on current and historical data.
        The association /parked is derived from the History object.
