    <p>
        The attribute /charge on member object is derived from firstly a mandatory member fee
        and a floating fee based on the amount of boat parking and the ParkingLot size.
        /chardge = member fee +(boat(s)*size).
    </p>
    <p>
        We have added an Size object which handle compare about boats and a their size relative to
        the ParkingLot of the boats to give a good matching from a size perspective. And since Member and
        Boat has a association it is possible to make system match members boats as close as possible.

        Object Role is created for the secretary to have a special role according to system requirements.
        I choose a system using roles over grouping because i find it more suitable to only add 1 Member to a role
        rather then forcing all members into groups.
    </p>

    <p>
        On object Payment there is an attribute called paymentOption which is an enum that represent different payment system from
        third party solutions. I could have displayed on Model that our third party inherit from payment
        but choose not to for understanding of Model.
    </p>
    <p>
        Calender and Event is a separate model from the other model. I Assume a programmer knows that Event is date based and a calendar
        also is so i did not model the attributes and relations. The requirement for secretary to handle booking of events is a system
        solution that is accessed through the secretary Role from other model.
